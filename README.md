# Optimization

This repository contains three optimization methods:
1. Random Search
2. Gradient Descent
3. Newton-Raphson 

It was presented as a solution for an assignment in Metaheuristic Optimization. SO, the code for the algorithms is written by me. Feel free to check it out if it will help you learn more about those three algorithms.

## Side Note:
make sure to install the library [Numdifftools](https://pypi.org/project/numdifftools/) seperately if you are running the notebook on Anaconda as it is not supported.

To install this package with conda run one of the following:

`conda install -c conda-forge numdifftools`

`conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 numdifftools`

`conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 numdifftools`

`conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 numdifftools`

However, The notebook will work perfectly fine if you have Jupyter installed seperately.
